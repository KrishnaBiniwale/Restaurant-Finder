# RestaurantFinder
Website that acts as a Yelp helper to find restaurants based on a user search.

# Frontend
Users can search for name and location, and sort by metrics such as best match, rating, review count, and distance.
Furthermore, users can select various restaurants as favorites, which are saved based on their login.

# Backend
This website utilizes the Yelp API to obtain the restaurant locations, as well as various information about each restaurant.
Additionally, the Google Maps API is also used to create a instance of a Google Maps that users can select to find their location.
The information about users, such as their login information, as well as the information about restaurants is stored in an SQL database in PHPmyAdmin.

# Edit
Currently switching the PHP framework, so this site will be temporarily down.
